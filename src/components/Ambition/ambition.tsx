              I aim for a position that gives me the power to influence the
              world through technology. I want to be part of something big and
              bold, I want to make a dent in the world and I believe I have the

              I am future-oriented forever, and a fast mover. In this journey, I
              don't intend to lose my humanity. I want to be able to tell
              stories. This is important to me to go far enough, far that I can
              see what others can't see. I want to be able to make a difference
              in the world. I want to make it more young, more vibrant, and more
              alive.
